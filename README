In this lab, we are going to take a moment away from building
up our Poker project, and see how we can use a little data
analysis on what we've done lately.  You'll get to use your
Panda skills to analyze some data that comes out of your
probability evaluation code.

First, take a look at data1.csv.   This is our output
from running the probability calculation (that you did
in the last lab) on a large input file with 198 hands,
each of which has 4 cards, and was done drawing to 7 total cards.

Suppose for a moment that you did not have the probability
calculator you just wrote, but had the data in data1.csv.
Now, suppose that you had a 3 card (not 4 card like in the file)
hand, but still wanted to draw to 7 total. For example,
suppose the 3 cards you have are:

8c 7c 6s

The file data1.csv has 11 lines that have those three cards:
9d 8c 7c 6s,3131,7341,3036,556,10581,220,125,5,5
9h 8c 7c 6s,3262,7215,3147,572,10412,254,125,8,5
8c 7c 6s 2d,5836,11315,4010,700,2785,225,121,4,4
8c 7c 6s 2h,5912,11329,3914,736,2778,221,102,4,4
8c 7c 6s 3h,5848,11406,3915,667,2794,222,135,6,7
Ah 8c 7c 6s,5860,11446,3854,741,2739,230,116,5,9
8s 8c 7c 6s,0,8847,9541,2263,2746,486,1056,53,8
8c 7c 6s 3c,5038,10208,3749,692,2517,2668,113,8,7
Ad 8c 7c 6s,5999,11241,3896,690,2809,249,101,6,9
Js 8c 7c 6s,5893,11194,3942,701,2671,478,112,6,3
Jh 8c 7c 6s,6040,11374,3825,712,2673,246,117,4,9

We could use these 11 lines to *approximate* the probabilities for what
we end up with from 8c 7c 6s when we draw 4 more cards to have 7 total cards.
That approximation will be less accurate than if we were to run the previous
lab on the three card input above. This loss of accuracy comes from the fact
that we only have 11 of the possible 49 other choices for the 4th card.
However, this approxmiation should still be pretty good.

How can we do this approximation?   We can take all the matching rows, and
sum down the columns to get estimated counts of how often each outcome would
happen.  We can then take those counts and divde them by the total to get
probabilities.

**PANDAS STUFF**

Observe that if we had more data, our approximation could become more accurate.
If you look at data2.csv, you will notice that it is similar to data1.csv,
but has more rows.   If we were to search for rows that have our specific
3 cards, we would now find that we have 21 rows instead of 11---almost
twice as much data to approximate from.  Likewise, data3.csv has
even more data, so we would expect a more accurate result.

**RE-RUN your code with data2.csv, and data3.csv**

**Any sort of analysis?**
